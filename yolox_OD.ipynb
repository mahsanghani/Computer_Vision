        "# How to Train YOLOX on Custom Objects\n",
        "\n",
        "This tutorial is based on the [YOLOX repository](https://github.com/Megvii-BaseDetection/YOLOX) by [the Megvii Team](https://github.com/Megvii-BaseDetection). This notebook shows training on **your own custom objects**. Many thanks to the Megvii Team for putting this repository together - we hope that in combination with clean data management tools at Roboflow, this technologoy will become easily accessible to any developer wishing to use computer vision in their projects.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Accompanying Blog Post\n",
        "\n",
        "We recommend that you follow along in this notebook while reading the blog post on [How to Train YOLOX](blog.roboflow.com/how-to-train-yolox-on-a-custom-dataset/), concurrently.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Steps Covered in this Tutorial\n",
        "\n",
        "In this tutorial, we will walk through the steps required to train YOLOR on your custom objects. We use a [public blood cell detection dataset](https://public.roboflow.ai/object-detection/bccd), which is open source and free to use. You can also use this notebook on your own data. We will use Roboflow to preprocess our images.\n",
        "\n",
        "To train our detector we take the following steps:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Install YOLOX dependencies\n",
        "* Download and Prepare custom YOLOX object detection data\n",
        "* Download Pre-Trained Weights for YOLOX\n",
        "* Run YOLOX training\n",
        "* Evaluate YOLOX performance\n",
        "* Run YOLOX inference on test images\n",
        "* Export saved YOLOX weights for future inference\n",
        "\n",
